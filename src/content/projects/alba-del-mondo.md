# Alba Del Mondo

## Landing Page

![](https://i.ibb.co/yn4Szpr/alba1.jpg)

A landing page for the Alba Del Mondo music band. The project was created in collaboration with a UI/UX designer. The implementation of the project involved creating a fully responsive website that conforms to the graphic design created in Figma and additional client requirements.

### Tech Stack

Next.js, TypeScript

### What I learned

The most valuable lesson I learned from this project was working with the designer and the client. The design was created in Figma software. I as a software developer had to get to know this software. The second important aspect was to communicate with a client. During the development process I had to change the design several times because of changing client requirements. I also had to choice the best solution and tech stack to achieve intended goals.
