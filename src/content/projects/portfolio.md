# Portfolio

## A short business card

![](https://i.ibb.co/NnWmPNf/portfolio1.jpg)

On my portfolio page you will find informations about my education, experience, skills and done projects.

### Tech Stack

Next.js (App Router), TypeScript, mdx, gray-matter, markdown-to-jsx, SASS

### What I learned

In my portfolio website I used new approach in creating Next.js pages called App Router. It makes routing and rendering app much different than before. To store informations about my projects I used markdown. That was the hardest part in development process. I needed to use gray-matter to fetch meta informations about projects and makrdown-to-jsx library to convert markdown tags to html.
